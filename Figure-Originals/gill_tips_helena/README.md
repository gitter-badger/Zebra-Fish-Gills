The TIFF images in this folder are the microscopy images from Helena.
To display them in Fig07 of the manuscript, I loaded the TIFFs in Fiji and split the channels (> Image > Color > Split Channel).
The single channels (and the original image) were saved out as PNG files which are loaded in the cells shortly before the one that generates Fig07).
